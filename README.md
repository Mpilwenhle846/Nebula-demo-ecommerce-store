Nebula — Futuristic E-Commerce Demo

Nebula is a portfolio-only e-commerce demo website.
It focuses on visual beauty, futuristic UI, and premium animations — not real transactions.

🌌 Vision

Nebula is designed as a modern, sleek, violet / purple / neon blue themed ecommerce demo with:

gradient backgrounds across pages

floating glassmorphic island header

smooth scroll-based animations

modern typography (Roboto / Inter / Poppins)

visually stunning hover micro-interactions

Nebula is not meant to be a functioning store — it is purely for portfolio visual demonstration.
